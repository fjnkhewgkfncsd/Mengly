                During a recent school project, I had the opportunity to work closely with a team of classmates to complete a group assignment. Throughout the project, I actively participated in team discussions, shared ideas, and listened to feedback from others. We held regular meetings to track our progress and solve any challenges together. I learned how to communicate clearly and respectfully, delegate tasks based on each member's strengths, and support my teammates when needed. This experience helped me improve my teamwork and communication skills, and it showed me the importance of collaboration in achieving a common goal.
